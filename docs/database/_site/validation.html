<p class="label label-red"><strong>Validation</strong></p>

<p>When your transformed cohort data has been uploaded into the joint database, please log in to the database and confirm that your data are inserted correctly.</p>

<p>For information on how to log in, please <a href="/texts/EscapeNet_SOP_May2020.pdf">see</a></p>

<p>Please compare your locally transformed data to the insert in the database and validate the:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Number of records (rows)</li>
  <li>Variables included</li>
  <li>Distribution of data</li>
</ol>

<p>To validate the above, you can create a summary report by selecting the relevant data table and clicking Tools and Export &gt; Reports &gt; Summary. This summary report can be compared to the local summary statistics, sent with transformed data. If so desired, Simon Mathis Kønig will assist you in this process</p>

<p>Be aware that the number of variables might differ from the transformed data as all variables from the ESCAPE-NET variable lists are included in the database. Any additionally included variables not present in transformed data will be coded as “-2: not recorded” in the database.</p>

<p>Please fill in the validation document found <a href="/texts/EscN data validation SK270919.docx">here</a> and send to data manager.</p>
