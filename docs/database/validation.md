**Validation**
{: .label .label-red}

When your transformed cohort data has been uploaded into the joint database, please log in to the database and confirm that your data are inserted correctly.

For information on how to log in, please [see](/texts/EscapeNet_SOP.pdf)

Please compare your locally transformed data to the insert in the database and validate the:

1. Number of records (rows)
2. Variables included
3. Distribution of data

To validate the above, you can create a summary report by selecting the relevant data table and clicking Tools and Export > Reports > Summary. This summary report can be compared to the local summary statistics, sent with transformed data. If so desired, Simon Mathis Kønig will assist you in this process  

Be aware that the number of variables might differ from the transformed data as all variables from the ESCAPE-NET variable lists are included in the database. Any additionally included variables not present in transformed data will be coded as “-2: not recorded” in the database.

Please fill in the validation document found [here](/texts/EscN data validation SK270919.docx) and send to data manager.
