<p class="label label-red"><strong>Data Harmonization.</strong></p>

<p>The ESCAPE-NET data harmonization effort allows us to combine heterogeneous data sets from the involved project sites in order to carry out subsequent pooled analyses in WP3.</p>

<p>The two interconnected data harmonization committees have created a list of variables which are common to all cohorts based on clinical relevance and availability,
one for the SCA (case) cohorts and another for the observational prospective population (longitudinal) cohorts.</p>

<p>Before data can be incorporated into the database, data must be transformed according to the ESCAPE-NET variable lists.</p>

<p>In order to explain possible differences in the pooled dataset, we ask consortium partners to include, in the codebook, the local variable names, types, and coding as they are used in your respective cohorts as well as the variable transformation syntax.</p>

<p>Please see an example of a filled-in codebook (cc resus tab) from the Dutch cohort <a href="/texts/example-codebook.xlsx">here</a></p>

<p><strong>In summary, the tasks for the local cohort owners include:</strong></p>

<ol>

  <li>Fill in the codebook with the local variable coding</li>
  <li>Create a transformation syntax. The transformation syntax as noted in your codebook should correspond with the “real” transformation syntax used</li>
  <li>Create a data set of the transformed local variables. Each table (cc identifiers, cc basic, cc resus, etc.) should be stored in a separate .csv file</li>
  <li>Carry out quality control before transferring data for upload into the joint database</li>

</ol>
