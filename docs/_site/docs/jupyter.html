<p class="label label-red"><strong>Jupyter Notebook</strong></p>

<p>Besides the joint database, hosting consortium data, The ESCAPE-NET server host a main resource for data analysis; the Jupyter Notebook environment.</p>

<p><a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebook</a> is a web-based interactive computational environment that integrates code and code output into a single document that combines visualizations, narrative text, mathematical equations, and other rich media. Jupyter Notebook provides a graphical user interface that allows for live-coding much like R Studio, where the user can execute a code block and see the output of that code, printed below.</p>

<p>For a overview of the notebook document structure and use, please see <a href="https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html#notebook-user-interface">Notebook user interface</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Main features of the Jupyter web application.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>In-browser editing for code, with automatic syntax highlighting, indentation, and tab completion/introspection.</li>
  <li>The ability to execute code from the browser, with the results of computations attached to the code which generated them.</li>
  <li>Displaying the result of computation using rich media representations, such as HTML, LaTeX, PNG, SVG, etc. For example, publication-quality figures, can be included inline.</li>
  <li>In-browser editing for rich text using the Markdown markup language, which can provide commentary for the code, is not limited to plain text.</li>
  <li>The ability to easily include mathematical notation within markdown cells using LaTeX, and rendered natively by MathJax.</li>
</ul>
