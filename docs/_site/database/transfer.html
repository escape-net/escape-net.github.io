      <li>Create an encrypted 7z folder with the .csv files for each table. If you have any doubts about this step, see <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/203590/how-to-create-secure-encrypted-zip-or-7z-archives-on-any-operating-system/">How to Create Encrypted Zip or 7z Archives on Any Operating System</a>.</li>
      <li>Contact data manager and you will get a user account on a SFTP server, allowing you to move the data securely.</li>
