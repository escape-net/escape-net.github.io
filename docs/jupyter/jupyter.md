{: .label .label-red}

Besides the joint database, hosting consortium data, The ESCAPE-NET server host a main resource for data analysis; the Jupyter Notebook environment.

[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) is a web-based interactive computational environment that integrates code and code output into a single document that combines visualizations, narrative text, mathematical equations, and other rich media. Jupyter Notebook provides a graphical user interface that allows for live-coding much like R Studio, where the user can execute a code block and see the output of that code, printed below.

For a overview of the notebook document structure and use, please see [Notebook user interface](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html#notebook-user-interface).


**Main features of the Jupyter web application.**

* In-browser editing for code, with automatic syntax highlighting, indentation, and tab completion/introspection.
* The ability to execute code from the browser, with the results of computations attached to the code which generated them.
* Displaying the result of computation using rich media representations, such as HTML, LaTeX, PNG, SVG, etc. For example, publication-quality figures, can be included inline.
* In-browser editing for rich text using the Markdown markup language, which can provide commentary for the code, is not limited to plain text.
* The ability to easily include mathematical notation within markdown cells using LaTeX, and rendered natively by MathJax.
