    "content": "Joint database Both the WP2 and WP3 teams have been collaborated to build a secure data management and analysis platform where only authorized users of the ESCAPE-NET project are allowed to use data without risk of either unauthorized changes or unauthorized utilization of the shared data resources. The ESCAPE-NET database BC|GENOME and the surrounding analysis environment (Jupyter Notebook) is located on a private “secure cloud” server hosted on Computerome, the Danish National Supercomputer for Life Sciences. The server is accessed through a Linux Virtual Delivery Agent (VDA) that provides access to a virtual desktop (CentOS 7). The BC|GENOME graphical user interface and the Jupyter environments are accessed through the web browser on the secure virtual desktop. The server is network isolated, meaning that data can only get in or out of the server by the help of the data manager and dedicated Computerome personnel. Data management functionalities are restricted inside the virtual desktop: This means users are not able to download result files, graphs and metadata derived from research data without control of the BC|GENOME administrators and data manager. Before data can be incorporated into the database, data must be transformed according to the ESCAPE-NET variable lists (codebooks) agreed upon by the two data harmonization committees, one for the SCA (case) cohorts and another for the observational prospective population (longitudinal) cohorts.",

BC|GENOME User Guide This BC|GENOME user guide describes the general use, including upload of datasets (section 3.2) from the Computerome server to the BC|GENOME application (database). BC|GENOME Administration tools This document describes the tools for user and dataset management and for viewing BC|GENOME system logs. The first chapter contains general information for all users about accessing BC|GENOME main page and about changing user’s password. From the second chapter onwards tools for database administrators are described with the information about user profiles, and the changes logged in BC|GENOME. QC Checklist - case Please refer to this checklist for case cohorts when evaluating your transformation from local cohort variables to ESCAPE-NET format, to ensure that it is in compliance with the ESCAPE-NET format.

See qc checklist for case cohorts and qc checklist for longitudinal cohorts. When the transformation is done and you are ready to upload, please follow the steps below to securely transfer data. Create an encrypted 7z folder with the .csv files for each table. If you have any doubts about this step, see How to Create Encrypted Zip or 7z Archives on Any Operating System. Contact data manager (simon.mathis.koenig@regionh.dk). You will get a link that allows authenticated users to securely send files with end-to-end encryption. Clicking the link will take you to a page as depicted below. Tick the “File Encryption”, generate password and send the password in a text message to data manager, when you have sent the data. . Data manager will move the received data to the secure environment, hosting the joint database and upload the data into the database.",
